# Scopes (Bookmarks)

You can create focused sets of objects, event publishers or subscribers using the object list on AL Home screen and the "Add selected to Scope" button.

It is designed to help focusing on specific tasks or troubleshooting where a limited number of objects, event publishers or subscribers are involved.

Scopes are maintained in a local json file that can be excluded from source control or even be shared with other co-workers if needed.
